/****** QUERY 2  ******/
Q2. For the CustomerId = 1060 (CustomerName = 'Anand Mudaliyar')
Identify the first InvoiceLine of his first Invoice, where "first" means the lowest respective IDs, and write an update query increasing the UnitPrice of this InvoiceLine by 20.
A re-run of the query in Q1 gives the resultset in Q2-Resultset_Corrected.csv (corrected on 15th April 2018 - Summed values in columns OrdersTotalValue & InvoicesTotalValue were incorrect) .

If you haven't managed to answer Q1, add the following selection query to the previous update query: CustomerId, CustomerName, InvoiceTotal. The latter is the sum of all invoice lines for the target invoice. The target InvoiceID is purposefully not shown, but the resultset post-update is given in Q2-Alternative-Resultset.csv 

UPDATE [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines]

SET [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines].UnitPrice = [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines].UnitPrice + 20

WHERE [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines].InvoiceLineID = (

	SELECT MIN(C5.InvoiceLineID) AS InvoiceLineID

	FROM 
		  [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[Customers] AS C2
		  , [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[Invoices] AS C4
		  , [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines] AS C5

	WHERE
		  C4.CustomerID = C2.CustomerID
		  AND C5.InvoiceID = C4.InvoiceID
		  AND C2.CustomerID = '1060' 
)
